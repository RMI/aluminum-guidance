# RMI Aluminum Emissions Reporting Guidance
This repository holds RMI's Aluminum Emissions Reporting Guidance, along with licensing and related documents.

## Product Level Accounting Guidance
The aluminum accounting guidance can be found [here:](https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2023/05/aluminum_guidance_public_consultation.pdf)

### Principles
There are three accounting principles for reporting aluminum sector emissions using this Aluminum Emissions Reporting Guidance:

#### 1. Primary data
As much as possible, emissions calculations should be based on first-hand information from various
supply chain partners.

#### 2. Consistent boundary for comparison
Companies shall report emissions against a fixed boundary (i.e., a consistent
set of processes) to enable comparability and consistency between disclosures.

#### 3. Measurement made for market
Ensure calculation and reporting decisions enable the development of a market for
low-carbon products.

## Pathfinder Network Data Model Extension
In addition to the Product Level Accounting Guidance, this repository contains supporting documents for a [Pathfinder Network](https://www.carbon-transparency.com/) Data Model Extension for Aluminum, which is designed to be used in concert with RMI's Aluminum Emissions Reporting Guidance.

The Pathfinder Data Model is designed to enable the use of machine-readable sharing of product level information. Extensions to the model allow for sector specific information to be added to the data model. Technical guidance on the Pathfinder Network data model can be found [here.](https://wbcsd.github.io/data-exchange-protocol/v2/)

### Key Terms
Some key terms for understanding the data model extension:

#### Benchmarking
  Emissions associated with all relevant processes from bauxite mining to final cast-house. For more information see Sec 2.2 Fixed System Boundary of RMI's [Aluminum Emissions Reportings Guidance.](https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2023/05/aluminum_guidance_public_consultation.pdf)

#### Mine to Smelter
  The ore-based or mine-to-smelter portion of aluminum production. For more information, please refer Secs 2.3 and 3.2 of RMI's [Aluminum Emissions Reporting Guidance.](https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2023/05/aluminum_guidance_public_consultation.pdf)

#### Value Added Product
  Final cast-house products such as slabs, billets, foundry alloys, wire rods, and other specialty products. For more information, please refer to Sec 2.3 of RMI's [Aluminum Emissions Reporting Guidance.](https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2023/05/aluminum_guidance_public_consultation.pdf)
  
#### Full Boundary
  Emissions associated with all relevant processes from bauxite mining to semi-fabrications. For more information see Sec 2.2 Fixed System Boundary of RMI's [Aluminum Emissions Reportings Guidance.](https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2023/05/aluminum_guidance_public_consultation.pdf)
